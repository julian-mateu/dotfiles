## Install

There is configuration for `zsh` so first of all switch your shell from the default `bash` to `zsh` on OS X:
```
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

Run the setup script. It will interactively prompt you to install dependencies. It will not override existing config files, just rename them as `#{file}.backup`.
```
./setup.sh
```
